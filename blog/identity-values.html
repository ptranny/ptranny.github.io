        <p>I've taken a few different Myers-Briggs tests over the years and I consistently come up as INFJ. The descriptions are pretty accurate. I asked my sister to read the INFJ profile and her response was, “This is you to a T”. Considering she's known me longer than anyone and has intimate knowledge of all my human foibles, I think this is good testimonial. INFJs are principled, idealistic, conscientious, and they move through life with a clear sense of their values. They have a strong desire for purpose in life. Being intrinsically motivated by your own sense of purpose is like having an internal engine that drives the rest of your life. It means that when I decide something is worth doing, there is almost no obstacle that matters. I’ve jump-started new careers, projects, and ambitions from ground zero so many times now, and I don’t think I could have worked through the complexities and challenges if I didn’t have that strong sense of purpose to motivate me.</p>

        <p>If sense of purpose is like an engine, values are like a GPS system guiding you in the right direction. The values I’ve held most consistently throughout my life are connection, growth, and authenticity. I also inherited an external system of values which, when I was younger, I did not question that much. I think this is common, before you go through your own process of maturation and introspection. It’s hard to untangle which values are intrinsic to your nature, which are byproducts of the manufacturing process called "family", and which have been internalized through years of cultural osmosis. For example, I used to identify strongly as a helper, a giver, someone loyal and dependable and kind. I’m sure a part of me has always been like this, but I also grew up with the ambient cultural messaging about what it means to be a woman in general (an expectation of nurturing, rooted in our biological role as mothers) and a Vietnamese woman in specific (duty is tantamount, sacrifice of self for family). I still hold a lot of these inherited values but I’ve taken the time to examine them and have chosen what to keep rather than consuming them wholesale. </p>
                
        <p>You want to talk about ethics? When I was a brand new midwife I worked in south Auckland for the district health board and I would get assigned to all the women who didn't have a midwife of their own. They were usually marginalized - poor or transiently housed, mentally or financially unstable, or all of the above. My job was to make sure these women saw a midwife regularly during their pregnancy (regular meaning "at least once" because some of them would just show up at the hospital having seen no one at all). People think being a midwife is all about the birth but during the pregnancy is when you actually get a chance to mitigate most of the risks down the line. A lot of them were hard to track down and we had this policy that if they missed two or three appointments and you couldn't find them or call them you would take them off the books - basically putting them in the too-hard basket, palming them off to the social workers who were already overloaded. I decided I wouldn't do that.</p>
          
        <p>At the time I never really thought of it as an ethical decision but looking back now I can see that it was. We talked a big talk all the time about equity of access in healthcare but when it came down to it, not a lot of people were willing to follow up on these women to make sure they were getting care. I would drive to their homes when they didn't pick up the phone. Sometimes they didn't even have homes. I’d do visits in safe houses, boarding houses, the front seat of my car. I'll never know for certain the consequences of my actions because I can't observe the counterfactual i.e. what would have happened if I hadn't gone to visit them? They might have had safe, happy births even without my intervention. Being principled means you do the thing you consider to be right anyway, regardless of the outcome, regardless of who's watching.</p>
        
        <p>I don't often run up against tension or friction when working with others, but the few incidents I remember are also from my time at the hospital. After a baby's born everyone thinks the job is done, but the midwife is still busy doing all the paperwork and the cleanup. Birthing is messy; there's blood and fluid and you do your best so the cleaners don't have to be dealing with that. On one of my night shifts I missed a puddle of blood or left a bloody rag behind, something like that, and one of the cleaners just lost it, started yelling and screaming at me. I was in so much shock I can’t remember what I said or did, whether I apologized or tried to explain myself. I do remember feeling angry and defensive for being yelled at, and bothered that she thought I was too lazy or careless to clean up after myself. The fact was that we were all so tired, just trying to get through another busy night, and looking back now I’m sure part of her reaction came from her exhaustion too. I didn't have a strategy for dealing with that conflict; it just wasn’t a part of my emotional toolkit at the time. I think it would be different now. I like to think I’d be less triggered, that I’d actually have the presence to have a constructive conversation with her about it. I was so petrified of messing up when I was younger and it stopped me from being able to own up to my mistakes without shame, but I find it a lot easier now.</p>
