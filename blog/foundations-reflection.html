        <p>I understand that Dev Academy focuses heavily on core skills because programming is, like most human activities, a social enterprise. The fact that it is a technical discipline I think often obscures the fact that it's really a human-centric discipline at its core. The impression we generally hold of programming is that it's about learning the specialist skills at the human-machine interface, but it's just as true that a large part of making software is about the human-human interface. After all, we create software in teams, for the benefit of other people to use. We need values, empathy and self-awareness because those are the things that help to power any kind of collective effort, in any kind of context, not just programming.</p>

        <p>I wasn't surprised about anything in the core curriculum itself but I was surprised by how much emphasis was put on it, as much as the technical content itself. I didn't feel like it was a waste of time - on the contrary, it was a really welcome change from how most of my previous learning has been structured and I appreciate its holistic intent.</p>
