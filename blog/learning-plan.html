        <p>My long-term goal is to work freelance on a mixture of projects that I love – making movies, teaching snowboarding, and coding. I’m motivated by mastery, knowledge, making art, telling stories, finding joy, connecting with people and nature, experimenting, using my brain but also my body. Within coding I haven’t explored enough to know what I want to do specifically but I do know that I want to create beautiful, useful things that other people will enjoy using.</p>
        
        <p>I am a natural lifelong learner. I enjoy learning for its own sake, for the pleasure of just exercising my brain in new and different ways. This is my biggest strength when it comes to learning. My other strengths are curiosity, abstract thinking and reasoning, and being systematic and organized. My limitations are: sensitive to criticism, perfectionistic, prone to burnout. My main obstacle is managing internal stress, which usually results from deadlines, assignments I don’t enjoy, and not switching off. My strengths in organization and planning will probably be the biggest help. I can usually minimise my stress with good time management and making sure I plan for breaks and days off.</p>

        <p>During my time at Dev Academy I’d like to develop the skill of working collaboratively with others. This would include leading as well as following, collective planning, negotiating roles and tasks, and resolving problems and conflicts.</p>

        <p>I’m committed to managing my workload through giving myself an optimal learning environment. This includes both my internal and external environment. My external environment includes: a quiet space at home to study, good friend and family support, and reducing (and eventually eliminating) all work commitments. My internal environment includes eating well, planning for exercise within my day, and doing mindfulness and yoga daily.</p>

        <p>I meditate daily and when I’m getting stressed I usually increase the amount of meditation time I’m doing. Externally I’ll look for ways to decrease the load – reprioritising commitments, reaching out for help. I have a few different avenues to seek help, including the learner community at Dev Academy and the facilitators. My brother is a front-end developer who did six intensive months of self-study before he got his first job so he understands the commitment needed for this journey, and he’s also offered his help.</p>

        <p>I expect the facilitation team will point me towards resources when I get stuck and guide me toward finding my own answers. I expect they will provide clarification, a different perspective or an alternative explanation when I’ve already done my own research and still can’t find a good solution. I also expect that they will check in to see how I’m coping from time to time.</p>

        <p>I have several work days during foundations that I’ve already scheduled around. There will be some weeks I won’t have ready access to a computer while at work but I can still do the core content. I plan to work a week ahead for the tech curriculum so that I’m not rushed to finish it. I have no commitments during the bootcamp phase because I expect that will be the time I need to focus the most.</p>
