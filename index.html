        I understand that Dev Academy focuses heavily on core skills because programming is, like most human activities, a social enterprise. The fact that it is a technical discipline I think often obscures the fact that it's really a human-centric discipline at its core. The impression we generally hold of programming is that it's about learning the specialist skills at the human-machine interface, but it's just as true that a large part of making software is about the human-human interface. <a href="blog/foundations-reflection.html">read more</a>

        Imagine you are trying to file away your collection of books. You start with an empty bookcase. For lack of a better plan, you start at the top shelf and start filling it from left to right. When the shelf is full, you move down a shelf and start filling again from left to right. Repeat until there are no more books left. This is the way web browsers display HTML elements by default, in the absence of any styling rules, and it is called <em>normal flow</em>. <a href="blog/html-css.html">read more</a>

        My long-term goal is to work freelance on a mixture of projects that I love – making movies, teaching snowboarding, and coding. I’m motivated by mastery, knowledge, making art, telling stories, finding joy, connecting with people and nature, experimenting, using my brain but also my body. Within coding I haven’t explored enough to know what I want to do specifically but I do know that I want to create beautiful, useful things that other people will enjoy using. <a href="blog/learning-plan.html">read more</a>

        I've taken a few different Myers-Briggs tests over the years and I consistently come up as INFJ. The descriptions are pretty accurate. I asked my sister to read the INFJ profile and her response was, “This is you to a T”. Considering she's known me longer than anyone and has intimate knowledge of all my human foibles, I think this is good testimonial. INFJs are principled, idealistic, conscientious, and they move through life with a clear sense of their values. They have a strong desire for purpose in life. <a href="blog/identity-values.html">read more</a>
